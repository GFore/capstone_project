# BR'OCK
### The assisted brain clock

## Synopsis
A full-stack React/Node web app that combines alarm clock functions with brain-training flash cards. Set a timer and when it goes off you are served a set of 6 flash cards that you must answer to turn off the alarm.

This project was conceived, designed, and coded by Steven Kim, Stanley Chen, and Greg Foreman over a 2 week period for their capstone project at the completion of the [DigitalCrafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/) Full Stack Immersive Coding Bootcamp (Sept2018-Jan2019 Cohort). *BR'OCK* was built with React, React Router, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Javascript/ES6, CSS3, and HTML5.
